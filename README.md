## Hi there 👋
I am a backend-leaning full-stack engineer with a background in computer science and practical experience with AI and machine learning. I enjoy building typed, maintainable systems with clean abstractions and thorough testing — especially in Python, where I work extensively with modern frameworks like FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy.

Early exposure to functional programming shaped how I think about software — emphasizing composability, abstraction, and correctness. I try to bring that mindset into everything from API design to internal tooling. I’m especially interested in audio applications of AI, and maintain [Ultimate RVC](https://github.com/JackismyShephard/ultimate-rvc), a song cover toolkit engineered with clean architecture in mind.

**Ask me about**:

- 🌐 API development (FastAPI, Pydantic)  
- 🐍 Modern Python tooling (Pyright, Ruff, uv)  
- 🎤 Voice conversion (RVC) and TTS  
- 👁️ Computer vision (CNNs, GANs, XAI) 
- 🤓 What a monad is (functional paradigms)

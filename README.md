## Hi there 👋
I'm a backend-leaning full-stack engineer with a background in data science.

I like building fast, maintainable systems where clean architecture meets applied AI. I'm into typed Python, modern web stacks, and functional programming patterns that promote composability and correctness.


make code more composable, correct, and fun to work with.

I maintain [Ultimate RVC](https://github.com/JackismyShephard/ultimate-rvc), a modular voice conversion toolkit for TTS and song cover generation.

**Ask me about**:

- 🐍 Python tooling — Pyright, Ruff, uv (typed, fast, clean workflows)
- 🌐 Lightweight web apps — htmx and FastAPI (no SPA fatigue)
- 🎵 Audio ML — building with RVC and TTS pipelines
- 🧠 Functional thinking — types, composition, monads (yes, those)

Always happy to talk clean code, open-source projects, or well-engineered AI.

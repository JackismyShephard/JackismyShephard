## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a backend-leaning full-stack engineer with a background in computer science and practical experience with AI and machine learning. I enjoy building typed, maintainable systems â€” especially in Python, where I focus on clean abstractions, thorough testing, and modern tooling like FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy.

Early exposure to functional programming shaped how I think about software â€” emphasizing composability, abstraction, and correctness. I try to bring that mindset into everything from API design to internal tooling. Iâ€™m especially interested in audio applications of AI, and maintain Ultimate RVC, a song cover toolkit engineered with clean architecture in mind.
